# BnC: Shut up, baby

This is a git repository for 'BnC: Shut up, baby!', a RimWorld mod.  Please download from the [steam workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1873232905) for automatic updates.

This mod patches the mod [Baby and Children](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1641239442) to silence the babies crying.  I did not create the original BnC mod or any of it's previous forks.
